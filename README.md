# Module_2_Activities

This code module introduces students to the differences between digital and analog data, emphasizing how real-world signals are collected, processed, and experienced in real time. Students will examine why digital data appears as discrete points while analog data is continuous, and how analog signals must be converted into the digital form for computer processing. They will learn about the role of binary representation, transistors, and counting systems in this conversion. A hands-on activity will involve measuring distance, analyzing how thresholds can be adjusted for different applications, such as obstacle detection and automation. Discussions will address constraints in measurement techniques, alternative approaches to sensing distance, and how various methods can be adapted for broader real-world applications.
